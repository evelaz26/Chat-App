## Chat-App
This application was developed as a collaborative group project. The development focused on a user-centered design process with several prototype and user-testing stages.

The app was developed online in collaberation between five team members with the work split through pages of the app. The final protoype included is a web app representation of a mobile app. I worked on the following files:
*  **createGroupName.css** &  **createGroupName.html** The page after clicking 'Create Group' button on the home page. Sets the new group's name first, then the privacy setting.
*  **groupChat.html** The page after clicking 'Proceed to Group Chat' button on the join group page. Group chat where the user is encouraged to send a welcome message.

**Chat App Group Project.pdf** contains detailed descriptions of each step in the development process of this app. There are seven group report submissions we wrote with the following brief descriptions:
* Problem Statement - a description of the issue we have found with the popular messaging apps we use. In short, they are not elder and novice-user friendly.
* Project Proposal & Analysis - a description of specific high-level features we found the users we interviewed would like in the app and how they would benefit from them.
* Design - a group brainstorm of several designs for the app. There is a focus on extreme usability features to stretch the scope of our design biases.
* Prototype - several low-fidelity google slide prototypes were designed, tested with users, re-designed and re-tested. 
* Computer Prototyping - a higher fidelity Adobe XD prototype was designed and tested.
* UI Development - a description of the final high-fidelity prototype meant to portray the final product in feel and scope. 
* User Testing - the final round of user testing and changes made to the app
